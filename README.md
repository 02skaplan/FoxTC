##What is Traincraft?
Traincraft is a mod written for [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/), built on top of [Minecraft Forge](https://github.com/MinecraftForge).

It adds new functionality and looks to the vanilla minecarts, and some other areas of the game. It adds over 80+ trains, wagons, and other vehicles. It also adds a completely new railway system with curved tracks and slopes.<br/>It was originaly started by **Spitfire4466**, then jointly developed with **Mrbrutal**, and now maintained by **Mrbrutal**. It has had well over 1,000,000 downloads and has been in development since 1.2.x versions of Minecraft.

##What is this fork?
This specific fork is maintained by **EternalBlueFlame** and is intended to be a port and cleanup of the 1.6.4 Traincraft to 1.7.10, for the purpose of contributing to the overall project by bringing it to new minecraft versions.<br/>This branch is currently an unofficial derivative until otherwise stated by **Mrbrutal** and or **Spitfire4466**.

**Mrbrutal** and **Spitfire4466** still maintain full rights and project lead even in this branch.

##Why did **Mrbrutal** post the Source Code?
> Since Spitfire4466 and **Mrbrutal** are exceedingly low on time to work on this project, open source was the only viable sollution. But since open source is something **Mrbrutal** has never done on this level or size, and is a bit hessitant to do so. But in the hopes that he can still be a part of this, and so that we can make Traincraft great again, he has opened the source code for everyone to see. Furthermore, both versions of Traincraft will be open sourced, so that anyone willing to contribute will be able to contribute on both fronts.
