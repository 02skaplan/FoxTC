##What is Traincraft?
Traincraft is a [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/) mod built using [Minecraft Forge](https://github.com/MinecraftForge).

Traincraft alters the looks of and adds new functionality to various aspects of the game. It adds over 80 trains, wagons, and other vehicles as well as a new railway system with curved tracks and slopes.<br/>Traincraft was originally created by **Spitfire4466**, then jointly developed with **Mrbrutal**, and subsequently maintained by **Mrbrutal**. *This fork is maintained by several devs, including **EternalBlueFLame**.* 
Traincraft has had well over **1,000,000 downloads** and has been in development since Minecraft 1.2.5.

##what's this fork?
This specific fork is maintained by **EternalBlueFlame** and is intended to be a community made port and cleanup of Traincraft from 1.6.4 to 1.7.10. The overall purpose of this fork is to contribute to the Traincraft project by bringing it to newer Minecraft versions.<br/>This branch is an unofficial derivative until otherwise stated by **Mrbrutal** and or **Spitfire4466**.

**Mrbrutal** and **Spitfire4466** still maintain full rights and project lead in this fork.<br/><br/> **This fork has a number of issues, defined in the issues tab, which our current development group is unable to fix, development is ceased until someone can fix these issues.**

##Why did **Mrbrutal** post the Source Code?
> As of late, **Spitfire4466** and **Mrbrutal** have had little time to work on Traincraft. Open-sourcing the mod was the only viable option that would ensure its continuation. Message from **Mrbrutal**: I have never open-sourced a project on this level or size, and am a bit hesitant to do so. However, in the hopes that we can make Traincraft great again (no this is not a Trump reference) and that I can still be a part of this, I have open-sourced both versions of Traincraft  here on Github. Anyone that is willing to contribute can contribute as long as they have signed the CLA (scroll down).

##Contributing

If your IDE asks for a deobfuscator you can find it in C:\Users\[USERNAME]\.gradle\caches\minecraft\net\minecraftforge\forge\1.7.10-10.13.4.1558-1.7.10\unpacked\conf

Regarding new features/behavior changes, please submit a new Suggestion to the issue tracker before you write any code. This helps keep everything organized, saves time, effort, and reduces negative experiences all around when a change turns out to be controversial.

Setting up the project was made easy with the setup.bat file (doesn't always work for eclipse, blame forge).<br/>
Otherwise this project will follow standard Forge conventions. See [here](http://www.minecraftforge.net/wiki/Installation/Source)<br/>
After you finish the tutorial or setup, if it has not already been defined, you must manually define the root path of your JDK installation folder, and the location of your :ForgeBin:<br/>
You must also import the required API libraries for the related mods if it is not done automatically (ic2, Buildcraft, railcraft, etc).

##License

<h3>Official builds will be provided by us when we reach stable periods in development, we do this to prevent server/save corruption for users which is especially likely with what, and how much, needs to undergo changing in TC.
